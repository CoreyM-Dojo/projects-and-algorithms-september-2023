# Strings

## Office Hours

## Objectives

- Get a better understanding of how to use strings
- Work on some problem solving algorithms with strings.
- Get to know some of the built in string functions

## Lecture

### Strings Fundamentals

- Immutable vs Mutable
- Create string
- get characters from strings
- looping through strings

### String methods

    - toUpperCase
    - toLowerCase
    - indexOf
    - includes
    - slice/substring
    - split
    - join

### String problems

- Capitalize: Given a string, capitalize the first letter of each word in the sentence
- isPalindrome

### Group Algorithms

- Search: Given a string that takes in a substring, return the starting index of the substring if it is not surrounded by any characters but spaces. 

- Get numbers: Given a string, return true or false if it contains numbers

- parseInt: Given a string, check if it contains numbers and return the first group of consecutive numbers as an integer

Space and Time Complexity -> can be separate


Omega -> Worst case scenario: If the page is the last page in the book -> will dynamically change based on size of entry 
Theta -> 1 iteration: if the page you are looking for is page 1

Constant Time Complexity -> O(1)
Linear Time Complexity -> O(n)
With Binary search -> O(log2(n))
Exponential Time Complexity O(n^2)
